Hello! I am a political scientist studying environmental politics with a focus on Latin America. I primarily study how *elections* and *referendum* affect environmental outcomes like deforestation and pollution, and the consequences of pollution and climate change on *political behavior* and *policy*. 

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford - Department of Politics and International Relations. I am also a member of the [Climate Vulnerability Project](https://climatevulnerability.wordpress.com/). Prior to starting at Oxford, I received my PhD in Government from the University of Texas at Austin in 2024. 

I am on the 2025 academic job market.
